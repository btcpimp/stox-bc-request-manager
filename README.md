# Request Manager

The Request Manager holds the data of all pending and confirmed requests related to the
blockchain. It acts as a manager service that sends and tracks the status of requests across all
microservices and handles their resolution process.

## Setup
install global packages
```
npm install lerna rimraf cross-env env-cmd -g
```
Installs all of the packages dependencies and links any cross-dependencies
```
npm run setup
```

## Build
To build a sub-system base image, you will need an id_rsa located at the root of the repository
```
docker build -f ./docker/Dockerfile -t request-manager --build-arg SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat ./id_rsa)" .
```

## Run
To run a docker container for a service:
```
docker run -d --name <service-name> request-manager npm start --prefix=packages/<service-name>
```
To run service containers:
```
npm run containers
```

## Test
To run all unit test
```
npm run test 
```
To run all integration tests in one container, first build the base image and then run:
```
npm run test:local
```

## Register all tasks
Register all services tasks to aws ecs by image name after login locally to aws, e.g.
```
node scripts/createTasksDefition.js <image_name>:<tag>
```
